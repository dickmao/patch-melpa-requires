;;; Commentary:

;; This package aims to Do the Right Thing by advising ``package-installed-p``
;; to disregard the MELPA-imposed version in ``PACKAGE-pkg.el``, and
;; instead refer directly to the Version header in package source files.
;;
;; To ensure the user has acknowledged the risks of `Advising Functions`_, he
;; must explicitly insert into his ``.emacs``:
;;
;; ::
;;
;;     (patch-melpa-requires-activate)
;;
;; Rationale: ``package-install`` generally will not update a bumped package dependency
;; because MELPA's timestamp versioning is incompatible with the semantic version numbers
;; in ``Package-Requires`` clauses (the Schism).
;;
;; The particulars of the Schism are expatiated in uninteresting detail in `Issue 2944`_.
